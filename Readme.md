# Matplotlib wrapper for generating nice looking plots

This is a wrapper for matplotlib with some commonly used plot calls that
can be used for scientific experiments.

You can set figure size and margin options for generating plots for publications.

Requires a latex compiler since the plots are generated using the latex backend.
You can set the same font and font size as in your latex document.
Check `pyplot/__init__.py` for the compiler settings.
